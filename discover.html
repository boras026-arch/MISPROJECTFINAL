                    <h2 class="section-title">Why I Chose University of Minnesota Duluth</h2>
                    <p>
                        I chose UMD because of its strong business program, welcoming community, and its great location. 
                        UMD provides many opportunities through education and personal growth. I appreciated the variety of 
                        programs and the supportive atmosphere that UMD is known for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Labovitz School of Business and Economics at UMD offers a comprehensive Business Finance program 
                        that aligns perfectly with my career goals. The faculty are experienced professionals who bring 
                        real-world insights into the classroom, and the program emphasizes both theoretical knowledge and 
                        practical application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond academics, UMD's campus community is welcoming and inclusive. The smaller class sizes allow 
                        for more personalized attention and meaningful relationships with professors and peers. The university's 
                        commitment to student success is evident in the resources available, from career services to academic 
                        support.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The location in Duluth also played a significant role in my decision. The city offers a unique blend 
                        of urban amenities and natural beauty, making it an ideal place to live and study. The proximity to 
                        Lake Superior and the surrounding natural areas provides endless opportunities for outdoor recreation, 
                        which aligns perfectly with my interests in fishing, hunting, and other outdoor activities.

                    <h2 class="section-title">What I Like About Duluth and the Surrounding Area</h2>
                    <p>
                        Duluth is one of the most interesting places I have been. For me it has the perfect mix of city life 
                        as well as nature trails and lakes. I enjoy walking the different parks and trails near campus like 
                        Canal Park. Lake Superior is super cool and in the summer it is a great place to hangout.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the fall this town has amazing colors and it is amazing to watch as things change. The vibrant 
                        autumn foliage creates a stunning backdrop for outdoor activities, and the crisp air makes hiking 
                        and exploring even more enjoyable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall it is a super cool area to live in and there is always things to do outside and new things 
                        that you are able to discover. From the Aerial Lift Bridge to the numerous hiking trails, Duluth 
                        offers endless opportunities for adventure and exploration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The community in Duluth is also welcoming and friendly. Local businesses, restaurants, and events 
                        create a vibrant atmosphere that makes the city feel like home. Whether it's trying new restaurants 
                        downtown, attending local festivals, or simply enjoying a walk along the lakefront, there's always 
                        something happening in Duluth.

                    <p>
                        One of my favorite aspects of campus life has been the opportunity to meet people from diverse 
                        backgrounds. Whether it's in the classroom, at the gym, or during campus events, I've made 
                        connections that have enriched my college experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The supportive environment at UMD has also been crucial to my success. Professors are accessible and 
                        willing to help, and the smaller class sizes mean I can get the attention I need to excel 
                        academically. This has been especially important as I balance my studies with my lawn care business 
                        and other commitments.
