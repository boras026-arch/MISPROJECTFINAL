                    <p>
                        Basketball has always been my favorite sport. I played throughout high school and continue to enjoy it 
                        as a way to stay active, build relationships, and develop leadership and discipline. The sport has 
                        taught me invaluable lessons about teamwork, communication, and perseverance that I apply to all areas 
                        of my life.

                    <h3>Fishing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fishing is my way to relax and connect with nature. I love the peace of local lakes, the challenge of 
                        the catch, and the memories made with family and friends. It's more than just catching fish—it's about 
                        finding peace in nature, quality time with loved ones, and developing patience and focus.

                <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a dedicated Business Finance student at the University of Minnesota Duluth, where I am pursuing 
                    my passion for financial planning and business strategy. My academic journey has been complemented by 
                    real-world experience, including internships with Northwestern Mutual, where I've gained valuable insights 
                    into financial planning and client relationships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond academics, I run my own lawn care business, which has taught me essential skills in professionalism, 
                    communication, and client relationship management. This entrepreneurial experience has strengthened my 
                    ability to connect with people, solve problems, and lead effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am actively seeking opportunities in financial planning and advisory roles, with particular interest in 
                    companies like Northwestern Mutual and Edward Jones. My goal is to combine my academic knowledge with my 
                    practical experience to help individuals and families achieve their financial goals.
